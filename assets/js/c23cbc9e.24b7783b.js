The interface allows you to automate tasks such as focus stacking and digital phase-contrast imaging.\n\n\n## Install Raspberry Pi + ImSwitch\n\n1. Download Raspberry PI Imager here: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/\n\n![](./IMAGES/Rasberry_pi_download.png)\n\n2. Flash Raspberry Pi OS 64Bit Bookworm Lite on an SD card with appropriate size (e.g. 64GB ) -> add the necessary settings (i.e. SSH, wifi password, uc2/youseetoo password/login ) )> Flash (was ist damit gemeint..? Keine Screenshots vorhanden..)\n\n![](./IMAGES/RaspiOS_1.png)\n![](./IMAGES/RaspiOS_2.png)\n\n\n3. Boot Raspberry Pi and wait until it\'s full there; ~5 minutes => It should be connected to you r wifi; you\'re computer should be in the same network (startet das booten, wenn man auf `weiter` klickt? siehe bild)\n4. You should be able to log into that using ssh => (Windows + R => CMD ) = > Terminal opens and then type `ssh uc2@IP-OF-YOURRASPI`\n\n![](./IMAGES/ssh_uc2_IP_of_your_Raspi.png)\n\n(You can find the IP-Adress of your Raspberry using e.g. angry ip scanner or a screen connected to your rapsberry pi)\n![](./IMAGES/angry_IP_scanner.png)\n5. Install imswitch; Go to https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchDockerInstall?tab=readme-ov-file#imswitch--docker-on-raspi and then follow the procedures: (wrong code on the website, no other than crack know what a sudo is)\n\nin the last line copypaste the following code: (not completly correct.. do you have to type ~ $ before as shown in picture?)\n\n``bash\nmkdir Downloads\nmkdir Desktop\nsudo apt-get install git -y\ncd ~/Downloads\ngit clone https://github.com/openUC2/ImSwitchDockerInstall\ncd ImSwitchDockerInstall\nchmod +x install_all.sh\n./install_all.sh\n``\nThis will:\n- install docker\n- install all necessary camera drivers\n- install imswitch via Python\n- create necessray startup files on the desktop\n\n6. launch it by doing; `bash ~/Desktop/launch_docker_container.sh`\n(hier fehlt auch ein screenshot.. wo soll ich das eingeben? in die reine cmd console oder muss davor wieder irgendwas aufgerufen werden..?)\n\n8. Go to your browser and enter the `https://IP-OF-YOUR-RASPI:8001/imswitch/index.html`\n9. Have a look for additional information here: https://openuc2.github.io/docs/ImSwitch/ImSwitchOnRaspi/ (nicht wirklich hilfreich)\n8. Close the applicaiton by hitting ctrl + c\n9. update the applicaoin by executing `bash ~/Desktop/update_docker_container.sh`\n\n## launch imswitch\nif you have installed it alredy execute the following\n\n``\nbash ~/Desktop/launch_docker_container.sh\n``\n(hier auch unbedingt screenshot machen!)\n\n\n## altternaive :\n\nFlash the pre-built image from this link using this software\n\n\n### Video Tutorial\n\nFor a visual guide on how to set up ImSwitch and control the UC2 system, watch the following video: (link wird nicht angezeigt. au\xdferdem zeigt das video nur wie man das programm benutzt nicht wie man es intalliert.)\n\n<iframe width="700" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iw_Bg9aYe1U?si=VQgLP854Hg29dwxW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n')))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},433:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/Electronics_Box_1-3269557009625b76e377f6fd0472e548.png"},26579:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/Electronics_Box_3-bea9ec89eee17abbe668fc3fee9e09db.png"},78366:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/Electronics_Box_5-7eb229e79087ca8dd26492ed044f9d47.png"},40911:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/LED_install-7a625fe1474da2de68203b394596c9a6.png"},75666:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/cameraaufnahme_fluoreszenz-5bd0d3dd539ff275d1c408b3e2106378.png"},94127:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/cameraaufnahme_hellfeld-b8a9405047dd185cb1503eee5ce01a6b.png"},99048:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/connect_again-40bb17d4a2f9eecf2f4f775109f339f5.png"},81446:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/diagramm-f88ac0545ded60289910741621735cdf.png"},15:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/fluoresence_microscope-382a7b492b766199a4c4dcc1fadea235.png"},2804:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/fluoreszenzshema-d6f02d40f2893f8a6cd03f0a7b35e8fa.png"},53331:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/install_esp-aecf15537feb60aac4c4394406ff16ed.png"},53286:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>o});const o=n.p+"assets/images/port_selection-acc4a8587f23bdb66d778ec5deded47f.png"}}]);
