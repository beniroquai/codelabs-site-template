## Introduction

The openUC2 XIAO Microscope is a revolutionary step towards making high-quality, automated microscopy accessible to everyone. Created in collaboration with Seeed Studio, this device is ideal for hackers, optics newcomers, and biologists. It offers more functionalities than a standard USB microscope, including timelapse, autofocusing, and autonomous operation with image storage on an SD card. This guide will help you understand the capabilities of the openUC2 XIAO Microscope and provide a comprehensive tutorial for its use.

*From Rapid Prototyping in Optics to a powerful microscopy-engine for your tinkering project*

## Key Features

- **Powerful Camera**: Equipped with the ESP32-S3 camera and an OV2560 sensor, it streams high-resolution microscopic images to your screen, supported by Arduino and CircuitPython.
- **Micrometer-Precise Focus**: The metal-based focusing mechanism ensures precise movement of the objective lens, allowing for detailed studies. It supports motorized focus stacking for automation.
- **Robust Power Design**: The solid housing ensures reliability for everyday field research.
- **Swappable Microscope Objectives**: Easily change magnifications to observe live samples from different angles.
- **Customized Firmware**: Utilizes TinyML for on-the-fly image processing directly on the MCU, integrating sensors and other hardware for automated experiments.

## Product Description

The openUC2 XIAO Microscope features a solid body, a high-quality camera for image transfer, and optics for magnification. The modular design allows for the integration of various optical elements like lenses, mirrors, or cameras housed in cubes. These cubes can be combined to create sophisticated optical assemblies, including microscopes, with the flexibility to add autofocusing modules or motorized stages.

## Getting Started

The openUC2 XIAO Microscope is a combination of the MatchboxScope (based on the ESP32 camera) and the UC2 modular system. The firmware is open-source and can be flashed using a web interface.

1. Connect the Xiao via USB-C to your computer.
2. Visit [Matchboxscope Firmware](https://matchboxscope.github.io/firmware/FLASH.html) to flash the Xiao firmware.
3. The microscope creates a Wi-Fi hotspot named `OpenUC2xSeeed-XXXXX` (where `XXXXX` is the MAC address).
4. Connect to this hotspot using your laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
5. Access the web interface at `192.168.4.1` to stream images and adjust settings.

For enhanced functionality, download the [Anglerfish APP](https://github.com/Matchboxscope/Anglerfish-APP/releases) for additional features like video storage and external hardware control.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Field Tripping
- Take the microscope and explore the microverse wherever you go

### Experiment 2: Autofocus and Miniaturized Stage for Large Samples with the UC2 Electronic
- Implement a motorized stage for precise sample positioning and autofocusing.
- Use external electronics to control fluid samples and capture images as they move. Curious? Click [here](./)


### Experiment 3: Timelapse of Yeast Cells
- Capture the growth of yeast cells over time to study their behavior and development.
