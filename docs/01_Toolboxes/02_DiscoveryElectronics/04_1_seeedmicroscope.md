## Getting Started

The openUC2 XIAO Microscope is a combination of the MatchboxScope (based on the ESP32 camera) and the UC2 modular system. The firmware is open-source and can be flashed using a web interface.

1. Connect the Xiao via USB-C to your computer.
2. Visit [Matchboxscope Firmware](https://matchboxscope.github.io/firmware/FLASH.html) to flash the Xiao firmware.
3. The microscope creates a Wi-Fi hotspot named `OpenUC2xSeeed-XXXXX` (where `XXXXX` is the MAC address).
4. Connect to this hotspot using your laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
5. Access the web interface at `192.168.4.1` to stream images and adjust settings.

For enhanced functionality, download the [Anglerfish APP](https://github.com/Matchboxscope/Anglerfish-APP/releases) for additional features like video storage and external hardware control.

#### 2. Setting Up the Microscope

1. **Power Up**: Connect the openUC2 XIAO Microscope to a power source using the USB cable. This can be either a power bank or your smartphone.

2. **Illumination**: Use the flashlight to illuminate the sample from above or below, as needed.

#### 3. Analyzing the Sample

1. **Connecting to the Microscope**:
    - Turn on the openUC2 XIAO Microscope.
    - Connect your smartphone to the microscope's Wi-Fi hotspot, named `OpenUC2xSeeed-XXXXX` (where `XXXXX` is the MAC address).
    - Open a web browser and navigate to `192.168.4.1` to access the microscope's web interface.
    - Alternatively, you can use the openUC2 Android app to view the live stream.

2. **Placing the Sample**:
    - Place the petri dish with your water sample on the microscope stage.
    - Ensure that the sample is directly under the objective lens.

3. **Focusing the Microscope**:
    - Start the live stream on the web interface or the Android app.
    - Observe the live feed and adjust the position of the sample to find areas with potential microscopic details.
    - Use the focus knob to move the objective lens up and down while observing the live stream for changes in contrast and sharpness.
    - Continue adjusting until the sample is in sharp focus.

4. **Exploring the Sample**:
    - Once focused, move the sample in the XY direction to explore different areas.
    - Look for interesting microscopic structures such as single-celled organisms, fibers, or particles.

#### 4. Sharing Your Findings

- Capture images or record videos of interesting findings directly from the web interface or app.
- Share your discoveries on social media using the hashtag #openUC2. You can also post your images on the openUC2 Twitter channel to share with the community.

### Tips and Tricks

- Ensure the sample is relatively still to get clear images.
- If the sample contains a lot of debris, let it settle before placing it under the microscope.
- Use different lighting angles to enhance the visibility of certain structures.

### Example Observations

During our field trip to the Bavarian Alps, we collected various water samples and observed the following:
- **Microplastics**: Small fibers from textiles and plastics were clearly visible.
- **Microorganisms**: Single-celled organisms were observed moving through the water, searching for food.
- **Debris**: Various small particles, including tiny stones, were also present.
