# Experiment 2: Autofocus and Miniaturized Stage for Large Samples with the UC2 Electronic

## Introduction

Why would one need a modular microscope like the openUC2 XIAO when a $10 USB microscope from AliExpress might suffice? The answer lies in the versatility and expandability of the openUC2 XIAO. This hackable microscope allows for the adaptation of various modules, enhancing its functionality significantly. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to add autofocus and stage scanning capabilities using simple components and a few 3D-printed parts.

## Connectivity of openUC2 with the Microscope

The general idea of connecting various microscope components like an X-stage or a focus motor to the Xiao Microscope is illustrated in the diagram below. The microscope provides a server and an access point for Wi-Fi. An app connects to the microscope to start the image stream and control camera commands. Another ESP32 with our firmware connects to the microscope via Wi-Fi, performing a handshake so the microscope recognizes devices like LEDs or focus motors. Control commands are sent from the app through the microscope to the motor, all using HTTP REST commands.

## Adding Motorized Focusing

The Xiao Microscope has a high-precision micrometer screw for moving the objective lens along the optical axis to achieve focus. For high magnification, a motor can help move the focus knob precisely without manual intervention. A simple and inexpensive servo motor can move the focus knob by Â±90Â°, connected via a slip clutch to avoid damage.

## Adding Stage Scanning

Stage scanning allows the automatic movement of the sample to enlarge the visible field. We use a simple servo motor to move a rubber-band-fitted sled, carrying the sample along an axis. This method provides a reliable movement path using steel rods salvaged from old CD/DVD drives.
